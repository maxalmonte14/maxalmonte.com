      <p>John looked at himself in the mirror as he put his uniform on. After years of training at the academy, it was finally his first day as a police officer. He could barely sleep the night before, thinking of the nice ring “officer Smith” had to it. His uniform was ironed to a crisp, and his black boots shone so bright that he could see his reflection on them. He was ready for the day, and yet, his shift wouldn’t start for a couple of hours. He walked to the kitchen and made himself some coffee. The small moka pot was blackened at the bottom after years of being put to the flames; it was a part of John’s life, like an old friend or a sexually transmitted disease. He sat at the round kitchen table and drank his coffee, savoring every sip. “This is it. From today on, I’m a police officer.” He thought. Since he was a kid, there was nothing John wanted more than becoming a police officer. “The real heroes,” he would call them. His parents disapproved of his obsession with law enforcement, “Son, you can be anything you want. A doctor, a lawyer, a teacher. You have so much potential. My son, give up your foolish dream of becoming a policeman, a tool of the rich, a pig!” His parents would say. But for John, there was nothing else, and he knew it; he was born to be a police officer.</p>
<p>The sun’s rays filtered through the windows as John finished his cup of coffee. The clock struck 7:00 AM. John was to leave if he wanted to be early on his first day. With his lustrous boots and a big smile, he left the small apartment for the New Town Police Station, where he was to report. Neighbors greeted him and complimented his uniform as he left the building, but others looked at him with disgust and even terror. John paid no attention to either thing. He didn’t care for what others might think or say; he obeyed only his heart and nothing else.</p>
<p>The summer sun was ruthless and the subway was crowded; the perfectly ironed uniform quickly became wrinkled and sweat-stained, and the boots lost its shine after being stepped on in the subway. “It’s not a big deal.” John taught. His spirit remained high, it was unbreakable, and he would allow nothing to ruin this day.</p>
<p>He made it on time to the police station and, with his head held high, entered the small building.</p>
<p>“Officer Smith reporting for duty, sir.” He said to the officer who sat at the front desk.</p>
<p>The officer looked at him with disinterest.</p>
<p>“You’re a new recruit?” Asked the officer.<br>
“Yes, sir.”<br>
“You can start by cleaning the toilets; there are supplies under the sink. The lieutenant usually arrives after 10:00 AM; you can discuss your assignments then.”</p>
<p>John got discouraged for a split second; he thought his days of cleaning toilets ended with the academy, but now he realized that wasn’t the case. With a “Yes, sir!” he marched towards the toilets, which were green-stained and reeked of feces. He covered his nose with the inside of his elbow and squinted while turning his head away. A minor setback, a pebble in the road, he would not allow this, nor anything else to ruin the day he became a police officer. With a bucket of soapy water in one hand and a brush in the other, John scrubbed each toilet as if his life depended on it.</p>
<p>An hour later, he notified the officer at the desk that he had completed his task.</p>
<p>“Did you do a good job?” Asked the officer at the desk.<br>
“Yes, sir. I put my everything into it.”<br>
“Good. I’ll recommend you as our official toilet cleaner. Congratulations, officer Smith, you got a promotion in your very first day.”</p>
<p>Other officers sat around, listening to the radio, reading the paper, or just talking to each other. They laughed at that last remark. John remained unbothered.</p>
<p>“Thank you, sir. What should I do next, sir?” John asked.<br>
“Gee. You’re a true G.I. Joe, aren’t you? Go stand at the entrance. Sunlight will do you good.”<br>
“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>John turned around and walked towards the front door. He could hear the rest of the officers laugh as he walked away from them.</p>
<p>He stood in front of the station, with his head held high and a straight back. Even standing under the sun was something he proudly did as an officer. And stand he did for hours, until the lieutenant arrived.</p>
<p>“Good day, sir!” John said.</p>
<p>The lieutenant looked at him, not recognizing his face. He read the last name sewn into John’s uniform.</p>
<p>“Smith… Are you new here?” He asked.<br>
“Yes, sir. I’ve been assigned here, fresh from the academy. I start today.”<br>
“Really? Come with me.”<br>
“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>John followed the lieutenant to his office. Every officer stood as the lieutenant entered the station, but he didn’t seem to pay much attention to it. He entered his office and sat at his cheap desk. The office was barely big enough for two people, but it had an air conditioner, unlike the rest of the station.</p>
<p>“So, Smith. We have very few rules here, but the ones we have, we follow. Do you understand?”<br>
“Yes, sir.”<br>
“Enough of that ‘sir’ stuff. Rule number 1 is do not do anything the rest of the agents wouldn’t do, is that clear?”<br>
“But sir, all I have seen them do is slack off.”<br>
“Good, you should try it yourself. Understood?”<br>
“Yes, sir.”<br>
“Now, we don’t want heroes here. Do as everyone does and you’ll get your paycheck at the end of the month. Does that sound good?”<br>
“Yes, sir… It does.”<br>
“Good. You are dismissed. Find yourself something to do.”</p>
<p>John got up from his chair and exited the office. The rest of the agents continued their activities and paid no attention to him. He exited the station and proudly stood in front of it with a straight back.</p>
