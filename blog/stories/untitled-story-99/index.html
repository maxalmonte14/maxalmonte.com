      <p>The back of the truck was dark and crowded. The driver’s instructions had been clear: do not talk, do not move, and do not breathe unless it’s absolutely necessary. I traveled alone and was fortunate enough to reclaim a corner for myself; pinned in between a stack of boxes, there was no one to talk to, and no place to move. Complying with the first two rules was easy; the problem was holding my breath. I knew he was serious when he said those who died would be thrown in the desert.</p>
<p>In the darkness, with only the sound of cardboard boxes rustling against the metal floor, the despair of the other men was palpable.</p>
<p>We had been on the road for 30 minutes or so when the truck stopped; something was wrong. The 200-kilometer trip was supposed to take over two hours.</p>
<p>The doors opened, and the once pitch-black back of the truck was illuminated by the moonlight. I closed my eyes tightly and groaned in pain; others covered their faces with both hands.</p>
<p>“Out! I got the heads up that there’s an improvised military control 10 kilometers from here. This is as far as I can take you.” The driver said.</p>
<p>The men started complaining. We had made it only a quarter of the way, and now he told us we were on our own.</p>
<p>“What are we supposed to do now?” Said one of the men, “We cannot go back; they’ll know we left the city.”</p>
<p>“You can make it to Hunger Killer on foot. Go across the mountains, it’s half the distance than going by car.” The driver said.</p>
<p>“You want us to walk, what, 75 kilometers across the mountains? Are you insane?”</p>
<p>The men’s complaints became louder; things were getting tense. The driver walked to the driver’s seat and got a shotgun from under the seat.</p>
<p>“I told you this is as far as I go,” he said while pointing the shotgun at the men, “if we continue ahead, we all get arrested and nobody gets what they want. Now you can either wait until I make the delivery tomorrow to take you back to the city, or you can go on foot from here.”</p>
<p>The men had calmed down, as one usually does after being pointed at with a lethal weapon. I got off the truck and asked:</p>
<p>“What way to the mountains?”</p>
<p>“All the way north.” The driver said while pointing, “If you don’t stray, you should reach Hunger Killer in six or seven hours.”</p>
<p>I started walking. If I wanted to cross the mountains without water or food, the best bet was to do it during the night, when I could save the most energy.</p>
<p>I heard shouting behind me, apparently some men were still not pleased; I also heard steps, some other men had decided to make the same pilgrimage as I.</p>
<p>We happened to go in the same direction, but we weren’t traveling together. This journey was one we were ashamed to share; the less we knew about each other, the better.</p>
<p>There was one man, however, who didn’t understand this maxim: Óscar Herrera. I knew his name because he approached me with the line:</p>
<p>“Hello, I’m Óscar Herrera. Nice to meet you!”</p>
<p>I ignored him. Turning my head in his direction would have meant spending extra energy, which I couldn’t afford. I was already putting a strain on my mind by filling it with unnecessary thoughts.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, he clung to me like a child clings to his mother’s skirt. Talking about this and that, asking questions I was not willing to answer, ruining my solitary trip. Not that he wasn’t allowed to walk next to me; he was a free man, same as I. I couldn’t do anything about it.</p>
<p>His ramblings sounded like a distant conversation to me; I had zoned out. There’s one thing I distinctly heard:</p>
<p>“When we get to Hunger Killer, what are you getting—”</p>
<p>I raised my hand in front of his face and stopped walking; he stopped behind me.</p>
<p>“I don’t talk about that stuff.” I said.</p>
<p>“So, you do talk! I already knew it, since I heard you talking back when the driver asked us to walk through the mountains, and—”</p>
<p>“Look, man. This is a hard and long road to traverse. I don’t have water or food, I have to conserve energy. Now, if you were to be so kind as to be quiet, maybe I could make it to the other side without fainting. OK?”</p>
<p>Óscar didn’t respond to my long rambling. Instead, he reached into his backpack and grabbed a bottle of water. He brandished it in my face without saying a word. I didn’t want to be indebted to anyone, especially not him, but I was thirsty. I grabbed the bottle and took a long gulp.</p>
<p>“Thank you, you are very generous.” I said.</p>
<p>He nodded, saying nothing in response. I let a sigh out.</p>
<p>“I give up. You can talk to your heart’s content. Just remember, we are hours away from our destination, and we must conserve our strength.”</p>
<p>I don’t know if it was because of his constant questions, his bad jokes, or merely the fact that I felt accompanied by him, but the rest of the way felt easier to traverse.</p>
<p>We arrived at Hunger Killer after dawn, it may have been seven, maybe eight in the morning. Out of the thick woods, the sun rays on the asphalt revealed Óscar had a prosthetic leg. I felt terrible. I had been dragging the poor man, assuming he could keep up with my pace. He realized I was looking at his leg.</p>
<p>“Don’t give me that look of pity. We all have our problems. After all, we all made this trip.”</p>
<p>I nodded. A new sense of respect had grown in me since the first time the two of us spoke hours ago.</p>
<p>“I guess we should go our separate ways now. I don’t want to invade your privacy.” Óscar said.</p>
<p>“You know what, it’s OK. We can go to the same place.”</p>
<p>We entered the same building, as equals, as friends. I took out my plastic yellow container from my pocket, he took a similar one from his backpack.</p>
<p>“I want this drug, please. It’s for anxiety.” I said, sliding a piece of paper over the counter.</p>
<p>Óscar took a look at the note and smiled.</p>
<p>“I’ll have whatever he’s having.” He said.</p>
<p style="text-align:right">THE END.</p>
