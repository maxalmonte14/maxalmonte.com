      <p>Jimmy wrapped his arm around the bicep with his belt; he was about to do it again. He could feel his veins pulsating, as if to call his name. He had been through this dozens, maybe even hundreds of times; he knew the risks, but he didn’t care. “This time I’ll get it over with.” He said. The needle and his skin met, how two lovers meet, first with a gentle touch and then sharing a single body. Jimmy’s pupils dilated, he felt euphoric, and his body was flooded with her essence. The two lovers had reached the climax. Jimmy gave himself entirely to the moment. His head leaned back, and his back violently touched the ground. His breathing became agitated; he smiled. His eyes shut, and then there was darkness.</p>
<p>Light shone brightly on his face. He covered his eyes with both hands; the light was gone, but the noise wouldn’t let him rest anymore. Steps, chattering, shouting, and metal crackling; it seemed to come from everywhere. Jimmy took his hands off his eyes, and a new world was revealed to him. He lay in the middle of a white stone road, surrounded by knights in chain mail armor, horse-drawn carriages, and merchants of all kinds. Jimmy stood up, and metal crackled as he moved. He, too, was suddenly wearing armor, and a long sword rested at his left hip. Jimmy set his eyes on the horizon, where an imposing white castle seemed to penetrate the sky and lose itself in the clouds. “This time I’ll get it over with.” He said. And putting one foot in front of the other, he marched towards the castle.</p>
<p>Jimmy walked with confidence as if this world were not strange to him. People knelt before him as he passed them by, and women murmured to each other and looked at him with lust. Soldiers saluted him and called him sir, and as soon as he set foot in front of the castle, the bridge was lowered to let him in. A knight rushed to the entrance and knelt before Jimmy, “Welcome back, sir. The king awaits you.” The knight escorted Jimmy to the throne room in the middle of the castle. The tall white stone walls seemed to extend to infinity, and the wall behind the throne was decorated with stained glass. The king sat on his throne, looking furious. Jimmy knelt before him, and the king shouted, “Raise your head and open your eyes!” Jimmy obeyed his majesty’s command.</p>
<p>“Don’t you know that while you’ve been gone, a thousand men have been slaughtered, women kidnapped, towns burned and barbarized?” The king asked.<br>
“Forgive me, your Majesty. I have no control over when I visit this world and when I disappear from it.”<br>
“Nonsense! What is this other world you keep talking about? Do you serve another kingdom?”<br>
“I do not, your Majesty. I have pledged loyalty only to this kingdom, and I’ll honor it with my life.”<br>
“You certainly will, Sir. James. I’m tired of your excuses. Now bring me the dragon’s head before the sun comes up tomorrow, or I’ll have yours in its place.”<br>
“Yes, your Majesty.”</p>
<p>Jimmy stood up, bowed before the king, and started walking towards the door. “Sir. James,” The king said as Jimmy came to a halt, “This is your last opportunity. You will be beheaded if you fail. Is that clear?”
Jimmy bowed his head to the king and said, “It is clear, your Majesty.”<br>
“Then be gone!”</p>
<p>The knight that had welcomed Jimmy before awaited him once again at the entrance, kneeling and gazing at the floor. Jimmy stood in front of him, “Speak.” Jimmy said.<br>
“Sir, how many men will you need for the king’s appointed task?”<br>
“I will not any. The kingdom has suffered enough in my absence. It would not be fair for more women to lose their husbands and for children to lose their fathers. I will go alone.”<br>
“I am sorry, sir, but that is madness.”<br>
“Perhaps, but it is what I must do.”<br>
“I will accompany you, sir.”<br>
“You must not. If I were to fall, you are to take my place. The kingdom needs you.”</p>
<p>Jimmy put a hand on the knight’s shoulder and gave him a nod. His horse waited for him in front of the castle; he mounted it and galloped towards the horizon, opposite to the castle, to the black tower. The people of the town cheered him as he passed them by, soldiers saluted him, women cried with worry, and children brandished sticks as if they were swords. Everyone in town saw Sir James, the greatest knight the kingdom ever had, leave that day, although only a few thought they would see him return.</p>
<p>Through forest and swamp, his horse galloped. Passion burned in its eyes, as if it knew that greatness awaited his master. Jimmy’s calloused hands held the reins tight as he neared the tower, blackened by smoke and fire, atop which a black dragon rested.</p>
<p>For years, the dragon had tormented the kingdom; nothing could appease it, and no one could kill it. Yet, there was Jimmy, in front of the tower, screaming his lungs out, calling for the dragon. A deafening roar came from the top of the tower, and the sky became black as the dragon took flight. It was as big as an elephant, and its wings spread far and wide. Jimmy took his word and pointed at him, “This time I’ll get it over with.” He said. The dragon dived into Jimmy, and Jimmy, sword, ran towards the dragon. He felt an electroshock in his chest, and then there was darkness.</p>
<hr>
<p>“Time of death: 11:48 PM. Cause of death: overdose by heroin. The subject did not respond to defibrillation. I, Dr. Smith, pronounce him officially dead.”</p>
<p>Jimmy’s lifeless body lay on a stretcher in an emergency room. The greatest knight to ever live had fallen. His face looked peaceful, as if he smiled. Perhaps he did achieve that for which he strove.</p>
<p style="text-align:right">THE END.</p>
