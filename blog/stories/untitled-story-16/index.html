      <p>It was a cold winter night. Snow piled on the streets as it fell from the dark blue sky. At home, Abigail ran around, juggling pots and pans. It all had to be perfect that night, since her husband’s family was visiting them. Her mother-in-law, in particular, was never too fond of her. She would frown at Abigail when forced to look at her and talk to her with a tone of disdain. Nevertheless, the fact that Abigail was married to her son was not going to change.</p>
<p>Her sister-in-law was a nice lady half of the time. She would treat Abigail with love and care, but only in her mother's absence. In front of her mother, however, she would turn into another woman. Like a man turning into werewolf in front of the moon, this woman would turn into a monster when faced by her mother. The love and care of her actions disappeared, the sweetness of her voice turned into stone-cold silence, and the gentleness in her gaze turned absent. Such was the effect her mother had on people.</p>
<p>Abigail knew she was not well liked by her husband’s family, but she paid no attention to it, she could never leave her husband, might as well get used to his family.</p>
<p>A thumping sound was heard on the doorstep, then the door opened. “Honey, I’m home.” It was her husband, Jake. He stood on the doorstep, cleaning his boots on the front door mat. There, that will do it. — He said to himself. Jake entered the house, closed the door behind him, and took off his coat. Abigail walked to greet him. “It’s crazy out there, you wouldn’t believe it,” Jake said, and then proceeded to take off his hat and gloves. “Are they here yet?” He asked. “Not yet, dear. Why won’t you take a hot shower while I finish dinner?” Abigail said.</p>
<p>Jake sat on the living room couch and sighed. He was glad to be home, safe from the inclemency of the weather. The heat emanating from the radiator felt good on the skin. “Where’s Bobby?” He asked. Bobby was his old German Shepherd; he had had it since it was a little puppy. Bobby was not a little puppy anymore; at nine years old, it had lost its strength and spent its days quietly.</p>
<p>Jake walked to the kitchen. “Where’s Bobby?” He asked again. “Oh. I guess it’s napping somewhere, maybe under the bed. You know how it is, there was thunder earlier.” Jake's expression was one of understanding; it was an old dog after all, and the weather had been bad that night. “Do you want me to go bring it for you?” Abigail asked. “No, let it be. The poor thing is probably exhausted. I don’t want to wake it up.” Abigail smiled at him.</p>
<p>“How is dinner coming up?” Jake asked. “Splendid. It’s chilli con carne, the perfect dish for a cold day. You’re gonna love it.” Abigail replied with a smile on her face.</p>
<p>“You know what? I’m gonna take that hot shower you suggested. I’m tired.” Jake said. “OK, dear, I’ll finish dinner.” Jake leaned forward and kissed her on the forehead. “Don’t forget the avocado.” He said.</p>
<p>Jake climbed the stairs to the second floor and entered the bathroom. He took off his clothes and entered the shower. The water was hot, as drops of sweat in a sunny day, but it felt good in his skin. He took his time. A hot shower in a cold night was something to be enjoyed, to be savored, to not be rushed. Eventually, he had to get out though.</p>
<p>He got out of the shower and went to the bedroom. Since he wanted to look good for his family that night, he took the best clothes from the closet and put them on. He was fresh and dressed to impress.</p>
<p>“What do you think?” He asked while walking down the stairs.<br>
“Oh, dear, you look so handsome!”  </p>
<p>He looked around and then said:</p>
<p>“Right. Isn’t my family here yet?”<br>
“I’m afraid not, dear. It’s probably because of the snow.”  </p>
<p>Jake, visibly puzzled, slowly walked to the couch and sat down. I’ll give my mother a call. — He said. He reached into his pocket and took out a Motorola Razr V3, he then flipped it open and dialed his mother number. The call went straight to voicemail. Hmm, it would seem she doesn’t have reception. — He said. Abigail walked into the room.</p>
<p>“What happens, dear?” She asked.<br>
“It’s my mom. I called her, but it went straight to voicemail.”<br>
“Oh, don’t worry, dear, it’s probably because of the weather. You know how these things work.”  </p>
<p>Jake looked at Abigail in the eyes for a moment, “Yeah, you’re right.” He said.</p>
<p>“You must be hungry after working all day. I’ll tell you what. I’m gonna fix you a big bowl of chilli, with avocado slices on the side while you wait.” Abigail said.<br>
“I should wait for my family before eating.”<br>
“Oh, dear! They don’t have to know. Now, c’mon, sit at the table, and I’ll be with you right away.”  </p>
<p>Jake paused for a minute. On one hand, he wanted to share dinner with his family; on the other, he was indeed hungry.</p>
<p>“OK, I’ll eat some. Not to much tho, I don’t want my mother to yell at me for not having appetite later.” He said.<br>
“Don’t worry, dear. You go sit at the table, and I’ll be right with you.”  </p>
<p>Jake stood up and walked to dining room, while Abigail went to the kitchen. Jake sat in the same place he always did. Abigail grabbed a bowl and filled it with chilli. One minute later and the table was served, a bowl of chilli topped with fresh cilantro, accompanied by white rice, lemon wedges, and avocado slices.</p>
<p>“I hope you like it, dear,” Abigail said with a smile.<br>
“Aren’t you going to have any?”<br>
“Oh, dear, no. As a housewife, I wouldn’t dare to start eating until your mother honors us with her presence.”<br>
“Suit yourself.”  </p>
<p>Jake took a spoonful of chilli and ate it. He seemed delighted by the flavor. It was good. — He thought. Abigail smiled, proud of cooking. He took another bite and immediately stopped chewing. He then took a long hair out of his mouth. He looked at Abigail with disgust. “Oh, dear, I’m so sorry, that shouldn’t have —” He slapped her across the face before she could finish. “I want another bowl. No hair this time.” He said. “Yes, dear.” She replied. Jake threw the bowl of chilli to the floor. It smashed into pieces. “And come clean up this mess, bitch!”</p>
<p>Abigail brought him another bowl of chilli, and started cleaning the floor immediately. No hair in the chilli this time. Jake quickly finished it and Abigail cleaned up the table.</p>
<p>“Was it good, dear?” Abigail asked.<br>
“It was good, it tasted so familiar.”<br>
“I’m glad you liked it, dear.”  </p>
<p>She looked at Jake and smiled.</p>
<p>“You know, I’m sorry for —”<br>
“Oh, I almost forgot!” She interrupted him. “I have a gift for you.”<br>
“A gift? For good ol’ me?”<br>
“Yes, dear. You stay right there, and I’ll go get it.”  </p>
<p>Abigail ran to the second floor and came down holding a big box wrapped in colorful paper.</p>
<p>“Surprise!” She said.<br>
“Whoa! This box is huge. You shouldn’t have.”<br>
“Oh, but I did. Open it”  </p>
<p>With a shy expression on his face, he started unwrapping the gift. “You know, you shouldn’t have gone through the trouble. And after the way I treated you. You know what? Tomorrow we are going to the — Motherf…”</p>
<p>Jake leaned back and fell off the chair.</p>
<p>“Oh, dear. Did my surprise leave you speechless?”</p>
<p>Inside the box were the severed heads of Jake’s mother, sister, and dog.</p>
<p>“W-W-W-What did you do, Abigail? What did you do to my family?”<br>
“But they’re here, dear. Didn’t you say the chilli tasted ‘familiar’?”</p>
<p>Jake’s pupils dilated, cold sweat dripped from his forehead, and he started vomiting.</p>
<p>“Dear. I made that chilli especially for you. Didn’t your mother teach you not to waste food?”</p>
<p>Abigail started kicking Jake’s head. As she did, his face would plunge over a puddle of his own vomit.</p>
<p>“You’re crazy. You’re crazy bitch! You’re crazy bitch!”<br>
“Oh, am I crazy? Are you afraid of me, dear?”</p>
<p>Jake crawled backwards in an attempt to get away from Abigail, but she kept walking towards him with a smile on her face.</p>
<p>“Get away from me, bitch! I’ll call the cops?”<br>
“You will? And tell them what? That the bruises all over my body are the result of you beating me every day after coming home drunk from your mistress’s? Go ahead, Jake, call the police. Call them. Call them, you pathetic excuse of a man!”</p>
<p>Jake crawling had left him cornered against a wall, he has nowhere to run, and was in too much of a shock to defend himself.</p>
<p>“Stay away from me bitch. Stay away!”<br>
“No, dear, I won’t. Not anymore. I won’t be terrorized by you, nor your mother, your sister, or your damn dog!” Abigail said while waving her forearm, which was full of dog bite marks, in front of Jake’s face.</p>
<p>Jake remained speechless, shaking, and sweating.</p>
<p>“You’re gonna die here, dear,” Abigail said.<br>
“W-What? What did you do to the chilli? Did you poison it? Did you poison me?”<br>
“For fuck’s sake, Jake, give me some credit! I would never ruin my cooking just to get rid of a piece of scum like you. No, dear. I have other plans for you.”</p>
<p>From her underwear, she pulled a Colt Cobra and put it right in his forehead, between his eyebrows.</p>
<p>“What do you think, dear? Does it suit me?”<br>
“Oh my fucking god. Oh please, please, don’t shoot me, please.”</p>
<p>As Jake pleaded for his life, a pool of urine formed under him.</p>
<p>“Jesus Christ, Jake, be a man for once in your fucking life.”<br>
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry, please forgive me, I’ll never hit you again, I’ll give you anything you want. I’ll disappear from your life, but please don’t kill me.”<br>
“Be glad that before I put a bullet in your head, the last thing you’d smell is the scent of pussy coming from the gun’s barrel. Last words?”<br>
“Please don’t do it, honey. I’m sorry. I’m so, so, sorry.”<br>
“Be sorry in hell. Motherfucker.”</p>
<p>From outside the house, white snow fell from the sky. It was another day in the suburbs.</p>
