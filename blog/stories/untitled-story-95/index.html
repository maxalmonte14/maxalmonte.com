        <p class="published"><b>Published:</b> 2025-11-06</p>
      
      <p>It started 20 years ago, I was still a college student at the time. Both my father and my mother were doctors; it was to be expected for them to put me through medical school. I never cared for medicine — or studying in general, for that matter — I preferred to live one day at a time, enjoy the pleasures of life, that kind of stuff, you know. When you have your parents’ money and decent looks, you can get away with anything.</p>
<p>Parties were wild back then. I started smoking, soon I was taking pills, and the last thing I knew, I was shooting the stuff straight into my veins. Everybody was doing it, I just wanted to be popular. More than once, I woke up in a pool of my own vomit, not knowing where I was, how I got there, or who the other people by my side were. Those were good times, but it wasn’t always a good time.</p>
<p>My grades started plummeting — they were never that good to begin with — soon I stopped showing up altogether. I was too sleep-deprived to care for classes, I never saw myself as a doctor anyway, there was no reason to waste my time in a classroom anymore. Thus, I partied some more: drank more, did more drugs, had more sex; it was great.</p>
<p>As to be expected, they kicked me out of college. My parents wouldn’t like hearing the news; therefore, I didn’t tell them. It was better that way, as I didn’t have to deal with their sermon and also got to keep the tuition money. A win-win situation.</p>
<p>It was naive to think that my parents, two professionals in the field of medicine, wouldn’t find out their son stopped showing up at medical school, but a man can dream. When they found out, a couple of months later, they were not pleased. They wanted me to resume my studies, but I wasn’t willing to put in the effort; thus, they cut my credit card and kicked me out of the house. I was homeless, but I didn’t really care; I spent most of my time out partying anyway.</p>
<p>What nobody told me was that nobody would want to party with you if you’re broke. I suddenly had fewer friends since I couldn’t afford drinks or drugs. I had my grandmother’s couch to crash at, and I could always steal food from her refrigerator after she went to sleep. She wouldn’t notice; most of the time, she would forget I was there.</p>
<p>But my grandmother’s couch and her cans of soup wouldn’t satiate my hunger for excitement. I wanted to drink, and dance, and make love, and wake up in a stranger’s bed in a pool of my own vomit; thus, I stole. That’s a sin right there, you know, “thou shalt not steal,” or something. Anyway, I started small, first I took grandma’s gold earrings; she was kidding herself by thinking she would wear them again, she wouldn’t, the lady was around 90 years old and almost blind, nobody was going to invite her to a cocktail party anytime soon.</p>
<p>I figured grandma wouldn’t need a diamond necklace, or a wedding ring, or a hairdryer, and as a matter of fact, she didn’t. A toaster, a blender, and a TV all ended up in the pawnshop. I didn’t get nearly as much money as these items cost, but I was technically getting them for free…</p>
<p>Anyway, one day, grandma realized her TV was gone, and what’s more, the TV stand was gone too; by that point, the house was almost furniture and home appliances-free. I resisted the idea of selling the couch because I needed it to sleep on.</p>
<p>My grandmother panicked and called the police. I explained to her that it was I who took her stuff, and she hit me in the head with a broom while calling me a rascal. She was a saint, that woman, God bless her soul.</p>
<p>Now I was truly homeless. Fearing an encounter with the police, I left my grandmother’s house and never came back — not that she would take me back anyway. I stayed here and there, sometimes I slept in the park, sometimes in a shelter. Life had become harder than I expected. Most of all, I resented not having anyone to steal from. The cravings would make me squirm; I was on edge all the time.</p>
<p>I started stealing here and there, mostly from women who returned home after a day of work; they never carried much, but they were also less likely to beat me up than men — not saying that this never happened. My luck turned around when I exchanged part of my loot for a revolver; it wasn’t very potent, but it’d enable me to move to bigger things.</p>
<p>A hand revolver, six bullets, and insatiable cravings are a dangerous combination…</p>
<p>I used my revolver for the first time one night; I was shaking with excitement, but mostly because of the cravings. I entered the convenience store and asked for a packet of cigarettes. The clerk opened the register, I took my gun out. He raised his hands; it probably wasn’t his first rodeo. I told him what I wanted, he complied. I put the money in my pocket and turned towards the exit door. Someone let out a scream. I turned around and found the clerk holding a shotgun. I ducked for cover, the clerk shot twice. I shot three times, got up, and ran as the clerk reloaded his arm. The last thing I saw was a woman lying in a pool of blood. A woman whom I had killed.</p>
<p>That was the last time I used my revolver, and I’ve been sober since that day.</p>
<p>“Do you repent for your sins?” The father, hiding behind the confessional, asked.</p>
<p>“I do.”</p>
<p>“I have one more question, son.”</p>
<p>“Go ahead, father.”</p>
<p>“Where and when did that crime take place? The robbery and homicide.”</p>
<p>“I don’t quite remember the when; it may have been around mid-July 1977, in the grocery store near New Town Park.”</p>
<p>“I absolve you of your sins.”</p>
<p>A gunshot.</p>
