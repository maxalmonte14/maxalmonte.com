      <p>Everyone looked puzzled at the hospital’s board of directors; they still had many questions about the incident, and yet answers were scarce. “What’s the latest from security?” Marino, one of the members, asked. “We haven’t got any news, sir.” The secretary said. “Are these idiots even trying to solve the issue?” Omar, another member, said. Kevin, the chairman, sat quietly, passing a Rubik's cube from one hand to the other; everyone looked at him. “We are getting sued; they will call the press; it will be a disaster. I can already see the headlines, ‘Heist At The North Central Hospital’. Our reputation is finished.” Marino Said.</p>
<hr>
<p>The hospital’s inpatient ward was composed of two buildings: A and B, plus another building for doctors’ offices, ICU, laboratory, and other facilities where patients would come and go freely. Her name was Margaret Smith; she was 72 years old. She was admitted yesterday; cause: respiratory failure. Mrs. Smith collapsed to the ground, short of breath, while she was cooking lunch; her daughter, Maria, rushed to the hospital. Margaret has been in the hospital for over twenty-four hours now; she is stable and was moved to the inpatient ward. Margaret is resting in room 703.</p>
<hr>
<p>“Are we clear on everybody’s assignment?” Jason asked.<br>
“Yes, we are, sir.” Everyone said.<br>
“Let’s go through it one more time,” Jason said. “Wanda.”<br>
“I’m on laboratory duty, sir.”<br>
“Good. Jess.”<br>
“I handle the phone, sir.”<br>
“That’s right. Joseph.”<br>
“I— I work in…”<br>
“What’s the matter, Joseph? You forgot your duties?”<br>
“No, sir, I haven’t. I just—”</p>
<p>Jason grabbed Joseph by the collar, lifted him, and slammed him against the wall. Everyone else remained seated.</p>
<p>“I asked you what your duty was, Joseph?” Jason said.<br>
“I—”<br>
“You what, Joseph? You what?”<br>
“I take care of security.”<br>
“You see. That was easy, wasn’t it?”<br>
“Y—yes.”<br>
“Yes, what?”<br>
“Yes, sir!”<br>
“That’s better.”</p>
<p>Jason put him down and playfully slapped his cheek. He then turned to the group and said, “Listen up. We have one and only one chance to make this happen, and for that, we need each and every one of you to be fully committed. There will be no room for error. If we succeed, we succeed together, but if you fail, you are on your own. Is that clear?”<br>
“Yes, sir!” Everyone said.<br>
“Good,” Jason said. “Now, if you’ll excuse—”</p>
<p>A hand was raised in the air, as if asking for permission to speak in primary school.</p>
<p>“Yes, Bryant?” Jason said.<br>
“You haven’t asked me what my task is… sir.”<br>
“You know damn well what you have to do.”</p>
<p>Jason walked to the door, fixed his jacket, and then said, “We gotta have this done by 4:00 PM. Remember, not a second later. I’ll be in the car.”<br>
“Yes, sir.” Everyone said.</p>
<p>As soon as Jason left the room, everyone started moving.</p>
<hr>
<p>In room 703, Margaret and her daughter spent some “quality time.”</p>
<p>“I want to go home,” Margaret said.<br>
“Mom, you are still unfit to be released. You have to be patient.”<br>
“I’m fit. I’m fit as a fiddle. Now, you let me out of this bed and I’ll show you.”<br>
“Nice try, Mom, but no. You’ll stay here for as long as necessary. Besides, it’s the doctor who can release you. Not me.”<br>
“Ungrateful kid.”</p>
<p>Margaret turned her back to her daughter and wrapped herself in a blanket. Maria fluffed her pillow and smiled. Her mother was a difficult person to deal with; nevertheless, she was the only mother she had.</p>
<p>The telephone rang. Margaret was falling asleep; she grunted. “I got it, Mom,” Maria said while stretching her hand to pick up the receiver.</p>
<p>“Hello?” Maria said.<br>
“Good afternoon. Do I speak with Mrs. Margaret Smith?”<br>
“It’s her daughter, Maria, speaking.”<br>
“Good afternoon, Miss Maria. We are calling from the laboratory; we have the results of Mrs. Margaret's latest tests; the doctor told me to notify you immediately.”<br>
“Is there something wrong with the tests?”<br>
“I’m afraid I’m not authorized to discuss that matter over the phone, but if you wish to come to the laboratory, we’ll gladly explain the findings to you.”<br>
“OK. Thanks. I’ll be there right away.”</p>
<p>Step 1 completed.</p>
<p>Maria grabbed her jacket and said, “Mom, I’ll go get the results from yesterday’s tests; I’ll be back in a minute.” Margaret grunted. Maria left.</p>
<p>Step 2 completed.</p>
<hr>
<p>In the security room, a call was placed, “Chief, there’s a man on the first floor making a ruckus. He says he lost his daughter. Apparently, he works for a politician and is threatening to call the press. What do we do?”</p>
<p>Step 3 completed.</p>
<hr>
<p>The door to room 703 opened and closed; Margaret stayed lying with her back to the entrance. “Good afternoon, Mrs. Smith. Are you awake?” A manly voiced said. Margaret turned to him, smiled, and said, “Oh, hi, doctor. Yes, yes, come in. Please.” The doctor walked closer.</p>
<p>“How are you feeling today, Mrs. Smith?”<br>
“Fit like a fiddle?”<br>
“That’s great news, Mrs. Smith.” The doctor said while putting on a stethoscope, “Let’s see how your heart and lungs are today.”</p>
<p>The doctor put the stethoscope on her back, “Inhale, hold for three seconds, and exhale. Good, like that.” The doctor said. The doctor took the stethoscope from Margaret’s back and gave her a big smile.</p>
<p>“You are looking good, Mrs. Smith. Now I’ll need a favor from you.”<br>
“Oh, I can’t say no to a man as charming as you.”<br>
“You’re making me blush, Mrs. Smith.”</p>
<p>They both laughed.</p>
<p>“Now, Mrs. Smith, I’ll need you to take this cup and get me a urine sample. I know you did it yesterday, but we need it to compare the data and see your progress. Is that all right, Mrs. Smith?”<br>
“It is, doctor. I’ll get it right away.”</p>
<p>Margaret took the cup, got out of bed, and walked to the bathroom.</p>
<hr>
<p>In the laboratory, Maria waited in line to get the results of her mother’s tests. The place was packed and lines were long; it was always like this in this hospital. When Maria’s turn came, she asked for her mother’s results.</p>
<p>“Do you have a receipt?” Said the girl in the booth.<br>
“No, I don’t. I was called in person here to retrieve my mother’s results.”<br>
“Excuse me, Miss?”<br>
“They called my room; they said it was urgent. I came to get my mother’s test results.”<br>
“I’m sorry, Miss, but that’s impossible. Our telephones can’t contact the patients’ rooms.”<br>
“Are you new here? I want to speak with your supervisor.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Margaret came out of the bathroom with a half-filled cup of urine in her hand and a smile on her face. “Sorry to keep you waiting, doctor, my kidneys are not what they used— Doctor…?”</p>
<p>The doctor was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>Margaret dragged her feet to bed and put the urine cup on the night table. She stared at the table; something about it was different, but she couldn’t put her finger on it. She kept staring as if absorbed by the thought that something was wrong, when suddenly she realized. The telephone. It was gone. Margaret started to panic; she opened the drawers and they were empty, the closet was empty, and even the mini refrigerator was empty. Everything was gone.</p>
<p>Gibbering and waving her arms in the air, she exited the room. The commotion called the nurses' attention, and they ran to her to ask what the problem was.</p>
<p>“Thief!” Margaret said.</p>
<p>Step 4 completed.</p>
<hr>
<p>It was 3:52 PM. Jason waited in the parking lot; one hand in the ignition, the other on the wheel. Wanda, Jess, and Joseph were already sitting in the back of the car; they waited for Bryant, the man of the hour.</p>
<p>“You think he’s gonna make it?” Joseph asked.<br>
“We don’t talk in the car,” Jason said.<br>
“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>It was 3:58 PM. Jason started the car.</p>
<p>“But, sir, Joseph is not here yet,” Joseph said.<br>
“We don’t talk in the car,” Jason said. “You can either be early or late. There’s no such a thing as on time.”</p>
<p>As the car started leaving the parking lot, Bryant raced towards it with a black traveling bag in his hands. He made it.</p>
<p>“Did you get it?” Jason asked.<br>
“Yes, I did. Sir.” Bryant replied.</p>
<p>He opened the bag and everyone looked inside.</p>
<p>“Nice work,” Jason said.</p>
